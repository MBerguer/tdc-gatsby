  Project built using Gatsby to show data from a GitHub user
</h1>


_This is a proof of concept to show data using the official [GraphQL](https://developer.github.com/v4/explorer/) API from Github._

## About

**This repo is a fork from the official Gatsby default starter.**

    ```
    gatsby new my-default-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default
    ```

## Requirements:

- Git
- Node (version 10 or later)
- Gatsby ```npm install -g gatsby-cli```
- Github Auth token (read https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)

## Instructions to run this locally:

- Clone the repo  ```git clone https://github.com/MBerguer/tdc-gatsby.git```
- Run ```npm install```
- Run ```export AUTH_TOKEN= ....... ``` with your own Github access token generated using the link  provided on the last section.
- Run ```gatsby develop```
- Go to `http://localhost:8000`

## Tools used

- [Primer CSS](https://primer.style/): As I wanted this site to look as similar as we were directly on the user details page, I used the GitHubâ€™s design system.
- [GraphQl](https://graphql.org/): to fetch the data from the API.
- [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/): To deploy this app.
